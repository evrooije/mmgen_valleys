This is a fork of and partial rewrite to fit the valleys Lua mapgen into the [multi_map framework](https://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?t=20573). This is in a separate repository as the original mapgen is GPL licensed and can therefore not be included in the multi_map repositories (conflicting licenses).

Derived from the original valleys mod created by Gael-de-Sailly and now developed by **Gael-de-Sailly**, **duane-r** and **vlapsley**.
